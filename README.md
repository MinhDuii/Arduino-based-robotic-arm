# Arduino-based-robotic-arm

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

## Used By

This project is used by the following groups:

- Company 1
- Company 2


## The three tasks have been covered

- Simple Tasks: The PS2 controller prototype allows the user to perform basic operations with the robot arm, such as picking up objects, moving them to a desired location, and releasing them. The controller's buttons and joysticks are mapped to these basic movements, providing intuitive control for straightforward actions.

- Moderate Tasks: The PS2 controller prototype provides more advanced functionalities to the user. This may include features such as precise positioning, rotation, and manipulation of objects with greater dexterity. The controller's analog sticks and triggers can be utilized to achieve finer control over the robot arm's movements, enabling the user to perform tasks that require more precision and accuracy.

- Complex Tasks: The PS2 controller prototype offers comprehensive control capabilities to handle intricate operations. This could involve executing sequences of movements, coordinating multiple joints of the robot arm simultaneously, and performing tasks with high complexity and intricacy. The controller's programmable buttons and customizable configurations allow the user to tailor the control interface to suit the specific requirements of each complex task.
